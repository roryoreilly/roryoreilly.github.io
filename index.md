The NFL released a competion on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020
The goal of this competition is to predict the amount of yards a player will gain by rushing the ball.
<br>
It was a project that was very interesting to me and great to work on and learn some new things.
<br>
For this project I featured engineered over 100 different types of stats related to the game and created a neural network to calculate the possible running distance for the rusher.

### University Projects

[Thesis - Make-Up Recommendation App](https://github.com/roryoreilly/thesis-make-up-recommender)
<img src="images/thesis-makeup.png?raw=true"/>
The thesis I completed for my final year in University College. This was a report with source code used to create my android make-up application. The application works by taking a photo of the user, analysing the skin tone, hair colour, eye colour, and the face shape using a machine learning model. With these features a set of makeup is recommended to the user that would most suit them.
<br>
With this project report I achieved A+ marks and it helped push me to achieve my first class honours.
