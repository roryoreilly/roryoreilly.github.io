## Personal Projects

[Kaggle - Santa's Little Helper](https://github.com/roryoreilly/kaggle-santa-workshop)
<img src="images/kaggle-santa.jpg?raw=true"/>
This project was from the Kaggle competition <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019">Santa's Little Helper</a>
<br><br> A number of ideas were tried for this competition. With the best results from using MIP (Mixed-Integer Programming) Solvers. Two solvers that I attempted to use were IBM's CPLEX and Google's OR-Tools.

[Kaggle - Big Data Bowl](https://github.com/roryoreilly/kaggle-nfl-rushers)
<img src="images/kaggle-nfl.png?raw=true"/>
The NFL released a competition on Kaggle - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020"> Kaggle Big Data Bowl</a>
<br><br>
The goal of this competition is to predict the number of yards a player will gain by rushing the ball.
<br><br>
It was a project that was very interesting to me and great to work on and learn some new things.
<br><br>
For this project, I featured engineered over 100 different types of stats related to the game and created a neural network to calculate the possible running distance for the rusher.

## University Projects

[Thesis - Make-Up Recommendation App](https://github.com/roryoreilly/thesis-make-up-recommender)
<img src="images/thesis-makeup.png?raw=true"/>
The thesis I completed for my final year in University College. 
With this project report I achieved A+ marks and it helped push me to achieve my first class honours.
<br><br>
This was a report with source code used to create my android make-up application. 
<br><br>
The application works by taking a photo of the user, analysing the skin tone, hair colour, eye colour, and the face shape using a machine learning model. With these features a set of makeup is recommended to the user that would most suit them.
